The demo program was written by Zia Khan (zkhan@cs.cmu.edu).

To build the demo:

make -f Makefile.demo 

To run the demo:

./demo

If the demo program is running properly, you should see three images
in the window.  The top image is the plain video feed, the middle
image shows how the pixels are classified, the last image shows blob
bounding boxes and centroids.

The colors to be tracked are specified in the file colors.txt

To use this release of CMVision, you should first install 
Video for Linux Two and ensure that it is working properly.
V4L2 is available at http://webcys.diads.com/bdirks/v4l2.htm
We have had good results using the Winnov Videum PCI card 
for frame capture (about $129), but other cards supported by
V4L2 should also work well.  A list of supported cards is
available at: http://webcys.diads.com/bdirks/peopleprojects.htm

To build and run the demo program:

   1) make demo
   2) ./demo
   3) see the file README.demo for more information.

To build CMVision as a shared library:

   1) make native

To use the JCMVision Java API to CMVision (note: this is still
experimental):

   1) Edit Makefile.src to reflect the location of your JDK 
      installation.  If you aren't interested in the Java
      API, you may need to revise the makefile to ignore the
      references.

   2) make header
   
   3) make native

   4) set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the .so file.

Look at the file cmvision.h for a definition of the C++ API.
Look at JCMVision.java for a definition of the Java API.

We are releasing this code without support.  We may be able to
help you if you run into a problem, but we can't promise.

<b>Welcome</b><BR>
<UL>
The latest release is version 1.0 (<A HREF="../../CMVision.zip">download</A>).
<P>
The MultiRobot Lab at CMU is pleased to announce the release of our 
real-time color classification and segmentation software: CMVision 1.0.  
The system supports tracking of several hundred regions of up to 32 
colors at 30 Hertz on general purpose PC hardware.
<P>
CMVision is a standard C++ library.  An experimental Java API is 
also provided.
<P>
The distribution includes a capture library for use on Linux with 
Video4Linux drivers.  The classification and segmentation library
can be used on any platform for which video frame capture is provided.
Classification and segmentation has been tested and run on Windows as 
well as Linux platforms.   
<P>
We have tested the system under Linux with the Winnov Videum V0 PCI ($130), 
the Imagenation PXC200 L-4 ($495) and the Imagenation PXC200 L-01 ($395).
<P>
The distribution is available at http://www.teambots.org (click on
the software link).

is available at

This is a beta release of TeamBots.

To complete the installation
----------------------------

If you are reading this file, you have successfully downloaded and
"unzipped" the distribution.  In the following discussion, we assume 
you have installed TeamBots in the default "tb" directory.  

To finish the installation, all you need to do is set your CLASSPATH.  
On Unix operating systems this can be accomplished by adding something 
like the following to your .cshrc file:

   setenv CLASSPATH /yourdirectory/tb:.

Or, if you use ksh or bash, in the .profile or .bashrc file:

   export CLASSPATH=/yourdirectory/tb:.
